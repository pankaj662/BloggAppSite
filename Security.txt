1. Introduction

This document defines a complete security architecture for a Spring Boot based web application, including authentication, authorization, data protection, rate limiting, auditing, exception handling, and secure deployment.

2. Authentication Security
2.1 Supported Mechanisms

Username + Password Authentication

JWT Token Authentication

OAuth2 Social Login

Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA)

API-Key Based Authentication

2.2 Password Security

BCrypt / Argon2 hashing

Salted hashing

Enforced password policy (uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol)

Password rotation after 3–6 months

Brute-force protection

3. Authorization Security
3.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

ADMIN

USER

EDITOR

MODERATOR

3.2 Permission-Based Access Control

read:posts

write:posts

delete:comments

approve:articles

3.3 URL-Level Protection

Only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.

4. API & Request Security
4.1 Rate Limiting

Bucket4j / Resilience4j

Prevent DoS

Protect login endpoint

Per-IP or per-user rate limiting

4.2 IP Blocking / Blacklisting

Temporary block

Permanent block

Country-based block

Suspicious device detection

4.3 API Throttling

Limits abusive API usage

Protects server CPU & DB

5. Data Security
5.1 Input Validation

Prevents:

SQL Injection

HTML Injection

File upload injection attacks

5.2 Output Encoding

Prevents:

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

5.3 Data Encryption

AES-256 for sensitive columns

HTTPS TLS 1.2+ required

Token signing using HS256 or RS256

6. Session & Token Security
6.1 JWT Security

Short-lived access tokens

Long-lived refresh tokens

Token revocation list

Token binding to IP/device

6.2 Session Security

Secure cookie

HttpOnly cookie

SameSite cookie

Regenerate session IDs after login

7. Infrastructure Security
7.1 SSL/TLS

HTTPS force

HSTS enabled

TLS 1.2+ only

7.2 CORS

Allowed origins restricted

Block unknown domains

7.3 Firewall

Application firewall (WAF)

IP throttling

Server firewall rules

8. Logging & Monitoring
8.1 Audit Trails

Record:

Logins

Failed logins

User activities

Admin-level actions

8.2 Security Logs

Monitor:

IP attacks

Rate limit violations

Suspicious traffic

9. App-Level Security
9.1 Anti-CSRF Protection

Enabled for form-based requests.

9.2 CAPTCHA Integration

Used on:

Login

Registration

Sensitive actions

9.3 File Upload Security

Type validation

Size limit

Store outside public folder

10. Deployment Security
10.1 Secret Management

Do not store secrets in code

Use Vault / AWS Secret Manager

10.2 Backup & Recovery

Encrypted DB backups

Automatic restore process

11. Threat Protection
11.1 DDoS

Rate limiting

IP block

Cloudflare/AWS WAF

11.2 Brute Force

Login attempt limit

Dynamic delay

Permanent block after repeated failures

11.3 Replay Attack Protection

Timestamp validation

Nonce (anti-duplicate tokens)

12. Conclusion

This architecture ensures maximum protection of the Spring Boot application using modern security standards and enterprise-level practices.
